nebenkosten
===========

This program provides a GUI for house owners to accumulate utilities (german: Nebenkosten) and split them among the tenants. Flats, lessees and advance payment are entered once. Assignments and running costs are entered every year. The program calculates the costs for each lessee and prints bills listing all costs as required by german law.
